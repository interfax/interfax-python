    :target: https://travis-ci.org/interfax/interfax-python

`Installation`_ \| `Getting Started`_ \| `Contributing`_ \| `Usage`_ \| `License`_

Send and receive faxes in Python with the
`InterFAX <https://www.interfax.net/en/dev>`__ REST API.

Installation
------------

This package requires Python 2.6+. You can install it using:

::

    pip install interfax

This module requires libmagic, for help installing on OSX or windows check the
`python-magic <https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic#dependencies>`__ 
documentation.

Getting started
---------------

To send a fax from a PDF file:

.. code:: python

    from interfax import InterFAX

    interfax = InterFAX(username="username", password="password")
    fax = interfax.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=["folder/fax.pdf"])
    fax = fax.reload() # resync with API to get latest status
    fax.status # Success if 0. Pending if < 0. Error if > 0

Usage
=====

`Client`_ \| `Account`_ \| `Outbound`_ \| `Inbound`_ \| `Documents`_ \| `Helper Classes`_

Client
------

The client follows the `12-factor <http://12factor.net/config>`__ apps
principle and can be either set directly or via environment variables.

.. code:: python

    # Initialize using parameters
    interfax = InterFAX(username="...", password="...")

    # Alternative: Initialize using environment variables
    # * INTERFAX_USERNAME
    # * INTERFAX_PASSWORD
    interfax = InterFAX()

All connections are established over HTTPS.

Timeouts
~~~~~~~~

The client takes a timeout parameter, this is a floating point number of seconds
for the client to wait between receiving data before issuing a timeout error.

.. code:: python
    interfax = InterFAX(timeout=0.001)

**More:**
`documentation <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#timeouts>`

Account
-------

Balance
~~~~~~~

Determine the remaining faxing credits in your account.

.. code:: python

    >>>  interfax.account.balance()
    9.86

Outbound
--------

`Send fax`_ \| `Get list <#get-outbound-fax-list>`__ \| `Get completed list <#get-completed-fax-list>`__ \| `Get record <#get-outbound-fax-record>`__ \| `Get image <#get-outbound-fax-image>`__ \| `Cancel fax <#get-outbound-fax-image>`__ \| `Cancel fax <#cancel-a-fax>`__ \| `Search <#search-fax-list>`__

Send fax
~~~~~~~~

``interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number, files, **kwargs)``

Submit a fax to a single destination number.

There are a few ways to send a fax. One way is to directly provide a
file path or url.

.. code:: python

    # with a path
    interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=["folder/fax.txt"])
    # with a URL
    interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=["https://s3.aws.com/example/fax.html"])

InterFAX supports over 20 file types including HTML, PDF, TXT, Word, and
many more. For a full list see the `Supported File
Types <https://www.interfax.net/en/help/supported_file_types>`__
documentation.

The returned object is a ``OutboundFax`` with just an ``id``. You can
use this object to load more information, get the image, or cancel the
sending of the fax.

.. code:: python

    fax = interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=["fax.pdf"])
    fax = fax.reload() # Reload fax, allowing you to inspect the status and more

    fax.id        # the ID of the fax that can be used in some of the other API calls
    fax.image()     # returns an image representing the fax sent to the fax_number
    fax.cancel()    # cancel the sending of the fax

Alternatively you can create an `File <#file>`__ with binary data and
pass this in as well.

.. code:: python

    with open("fax.pdf", "rb") as fp:
        f = interfax.files.create(fp.read(), mime_type="application/pdf")
    interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=[f])

To send multiple files just pass in a list of strings and `File`_ objects.

.. code:: python

    interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+11111111112", files=["fax.pdf", "https://s3.aws.com/example/fax.pdf"])

Under the hood every path and string is turned into a
`File <#interfaxfile>`__ object. For more information see `the
documentation <#interfaxfile>`__ for this class.

**Keyword Arguments:** ``contact``, ``postpone_time``,
``retries_to_perform``, ``csid``, ``page_header``, ``reference``,
``page_size``, ``fit_to_page``, ``page_orientation``, ``resolution``,
``rendering``

Helper Classes
--------------

OutboundFax
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``OutboundFax`` is returned in most Outbound APIs. As a convenience
the following methods are available.

.. code:: python

    fax = interfax.outbound.find(123)
    fax = fax.reload() # Loads or reloads object
    fax.cancel() # Cancels the fax
    fax.image() # Returns an `Image` for this fax

InboundFax
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``InboundFax`` is returned in some of the Inbound APIs. As a
convenience the following methods are available.

.. code:: python

    fax = interfax.inbound.find(123)
    fax = fax.reload() # Loads or reloads object
    fax.mark(true) # Marks the fax as read/unread
    fax.resend(email) # Resend the fax to a specific email address.
    fax.image() # Returns an `Image` for this fax
    fax.emails() # Returns a list of ForwardingEmail objects that the fax was forwarded on to

Image
~~~~~

A lightweight wrapper around the image data for a sent or received fax.
Provides the following convenience methods.

.. code:: python

    image = interfax.outbound.image(123)
    image.data # Returns the raw binary data for the TIFF image.
    image.save("folder/fax.tiff") # Saves the TIFF to the path provided

File
~~~~

This class is used by ``interfax.outbound.deliver`` and
``interfax.files`` to turn every URL, path and binary data into a
uniform format, ready to be sent out to the InterFAX API.

It is most useful for sending binary data to the ``.deliver`` method.

.. code:: python

    >>> # binary data
    >>> f = File(interfax, "....binary data.....", mime_type="application/pdf")
    File()

    >>> # Alternatively
    >>> f = interfax.files.create("....binary data.....", mime_type="application/pdf")
    >>> f.headers
    {"Content-Type": "application/pdf"}
    >>> f.body
    "....binary data....."

    interfax.outbound.deliver(fax_number="+1111111111112", files=[f])

Additionally it can be used to turn a URL or path into a valid object as
well, though the ``.deliver`` method does this conversion automatically.

.. code:: python

    >>> # a file by path
    >>> f = interfax.files.create("foo/bar.pdf")
    >>> f.headers
    { "Content-Type": "application/pdf" }
    >>> f.body
    "....binary data....."

    >>> # a file by url
    >>> f = interfax.files.create("https://foo.com/bar.html")
    >>> f.headers
    {"Content-Location": "https://foo.com/bar.html"}
    >>> f.body
    None

ForwardingEmail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A light wrapper around `the
response <https://www.interfax.net/en/dev/rest/reference/2930>`__ received by
asking for the forwarded emails for a fax.

.. code:: python

    fax = interfax.inbound.find(123)
    email = fax.emails()[0]
    email.email_address # An email address to which forwarding of the fax was attempted.
    email.message_status # 0 = OK; number smaller than zero = in progress; number greater than zero = error.
    email.completion_time # Completion timestamp.

Document
~~~~~~~~

The ``Document`` is returned in most of the Document APIs. As a
convenience the following methods are available.

.. code:: python

    document = interfax.documents.find(123)
    document = document.reload() # Loads or reloads object
    document.upload(0, 999, ".....binary data...." # Maps to the interfax.documents.upload method
    document.cancel() # Maps to the interfax.documents.cancel method
    document.id  # Extracts the ID from the URI (the API does not return the ID)
